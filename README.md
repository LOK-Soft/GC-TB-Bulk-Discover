# GC-TB-Bulk-Discover
After you visited an Geocaching-Event you might have lots of Trackable-Codes.
You can just go onto the gc-site and enter them one after another and copy-paste the "seen on XYZ-Event" entry.
Or you install this script.
Just activate it by clicking the "Open TB-Bulk-Discover Page" Link on your Profil Quick View Page (http://www.geocaching.com/my/default.aspx) or activate the script through the GM-Menu.
You'll see a sidebar on the left where you enter you trackcodes line-by-line, the date an your logentry.
Next to this sidebar you can see an iframe with the geocaching.com site where you log in to your account.
Then just click on the "log!"-button and watch the script open and log the trackables automatically.

There are some webservices doing the same, but you have to enter you GC-Userdata there and don't know what is done with that (except from the GC-Live-API enabled). This script works on your own machine afer you logged into your GC-Account, so it dosn't even know you userdata.
